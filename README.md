# RISCV Interpreter

For my Computer Organization and Systems Programming class, CS 3410, I built a RISCV Interpreter that supports a subset of about 20 assembly instructions. We built this using C, and implemented hash tables and linked lists for simulating memory storage and allocation as RAM.

We tested our interpreter using the fully working RISCV Interpreter, shown below:
