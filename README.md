# RISCV Interpreter

For my Computer Organization and Systems Programming class, CS 3410, I built a RISCV Interpreter that supports a subset of about 20 assembly instructions. I built this in C, and implemented hash tables and linked lists for simulating memory storage and allocation as RAM.

We tested our interpreter against the fully working demo, shown below:
